This is a library for working with (language-agnostic)
control- and data-flow graphs.

Although it doesn't (yet) look like much, the long-term goal of this project is
to provide a language-agnostic data format for describing control-flow graphs
(including callgraphs) and data-flow graphs as an intermediate representation
between language-facing tools like LLVM and user-facing tools like Cytoscape,
Dot and (maybe someday) a better cscope.
